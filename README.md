# Portable ESP32-CAM Security System
Low-cost, portable PIR-activated security device that detects motion, records video, and warns intruders.

At college campuses, it's common for students to leave dorm rooms or study spaces unattended, sometimes unlocked. Though buildings are secured, personal belongings inside aren't. Students voiced the concern, making it clear that many would feel more secure with a small, inexpensive system that could monitor space, warn intruders, and store evidence if something happened. The project was created to deliver that peace of mind using simple, accessible hardware.
